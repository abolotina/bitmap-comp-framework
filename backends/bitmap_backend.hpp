// raw uncompressed form, and it converts them into its own representation.
// Queries then refer to bitmaps by index.
//
// query_and() / query_or() must do the work *in the backend's own
// representation* -- that is the number the benchmark is trying to measure. The
// result is returned as a QueryResult, which still holds the compressed form;
// converting it back to raw words (to_words(), used only for verification)
// happens after the timer has been stopped.
