// WAH (Word-Aligned Hybrid) run-length compression, 64-bit variant.
//
// The bit sequence is cut into groups of 63 bits. Each 64-bit code word is
// either
//
//   literal: bit 63 = 0, bits 0..62 = the 63 bits of one group verbatim;
//   fill:    bit 63 = 1, bit 62 = the repeated bit value,
//            bits 0..61 = how many consecutive groups are all-0 or all-1.
//
// So a long run of equal bits costs one word regardless of its length, while
// anything irregular costs one word per 63 bits -- slightly *more* than the
// uncompressed 64 bits per 64 bits. AND/OR run directly over the two compressed
// streams: at each step the two readers agree on how many groups they can
// consume at once (min of the two remaining run lengths), so a query over long
// runs touches few words. That is the whole point of the representation, and
// the reason its query time depends on run structure rather than on cardinality.
